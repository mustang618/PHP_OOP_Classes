PHP OOP Classes

The files index.php and classes.php illustrate and example of PHP OOP and some of the possible relationships classes have.

For example...

The class ScreenElectronics is an inherited of the class Electronics
or, in other words, ScreenElectronics is a Electronics.

The class BatteryLife is a composition of the class ScreenElectronics
or, in other words, ScreenElectronics has a BatteryLife.

The class Adapter is an aggregation of the class Electronics
or, in other words, Adapter has an association with Electronics.

The classes ScreenElectronics and AudioElectronics are siblings.

There is also an interface iElectronics which is a bit much.

Finally it is briefly tested and results echoed on page.
